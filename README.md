- 👋 Hi, I’m @YasminSGold
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing(NLP)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning and NLP methods to gain an understanding of what's possible with machine learning while focusing on how we best systematize language in order to model it as accurately as possble with machines. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where linguistics have an essential role.
